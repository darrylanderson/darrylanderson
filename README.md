Hi, my name is Darryl Anderson, and I provide technology advisement and design and development services to early and growth stage software companies. Based in Chicago, IL, I primarily work with companies in the local market, but can also work with remote companies.

I've been building software products for 20+ years, across multiple domains including payments, healthcare (genomics, clinical trials, medical records), insurance, transportation, knowledge management, and telecom.

From a technology perspective, I'm passionate about cloud architecture, continuous delivery, devops culture, and security. I believe that architecture should support the business, and that common architectural 'ilities' such as reliability, scalability, maintainability, security, and extensibility are best achieved through cloud delivery models.

## Bio

I have 20+ years of experience in building large scale enterprise web applications.

I am currently a Staff Engineer at Adyen. Prior to joining Adyen, I was Principal Architect for Clearcover, a hyper growth insuretech startup where I lead the Architecture teams.

Prior to joining Clearcover, I was the co-founder of ChainFront, a blockchain services company. Before that, I was Chief Architect and Technical Advisor for project44, a rapid growth startup in the transportation logistics space.

Prior to joining project44, I was the lead architect for Oracle's Healthcare Global Business Unit.

These products combine genomic data with clinical data for research and point-of-care solutions.

I came to Oracle through the acquisition of ClearTrial, where I was the founding architect. While at ClearTrial, in addition to building the technical architecture, product development processes, and software development infrastructure, I built the SaaS hosting platform, achieving 99.9995% planned uptime since launch in 2006.

Prior to ClearTrial, I was the lead software architect at Participate.com, a knowledge management SaaS company. Acquired by OutStart Inc.
