## Hello

### tl;dr
I think we're second cousins and I'd like to say hi.

### ???
So I'm out in the burbs at my parents' house a few weeks ago and I ask my dad about his dad.  We get to talking and he mentions his cousin Clifford.
Apparently there was a falling out decades ago between my aunt Carol and Clifford's wife Clara and since then there's been little if any contact between the cousins.
I was curious so I did a little digging on the web, found some clues that led me to you.  If I followed the clues correctly then Clifford was your dad.
This past weekend we drove out to Elk Grove for a family reunion (Mom's side of the family).  Big family on that side - mom has over thirty first cousins.
It got me thinking more about family so I decided to reach out and say hello.  

### about me
I grew up in East Dundee and now live in Evanston.  Went to DePaul for undergrad and grad school - CS for both.  
Happily married to my wife Sunni for nine years.  Hit the jackpot with two healthy kids - Everett age 7 and Annaleda age 5.
Career in software engineering.  At Capital One for the past year and a half.  After working for one amazing boss, one terrible boss, and many bosses that fell somewhere inbetween I decided to give people leadership a try so that's what I've been doing for the past six months or so.

### what now
It would be cool to meet you in person.  Maybe we could grab lunch in the loop one day.  Don't really have any expectations beyond that.
If you'd like to be in touch my number is 773.383.1563.  
Apologies if you're not who I think you are :-)
